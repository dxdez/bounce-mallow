# Bounce Mallow

Bounce Mallow is a fast-paced platformer where you control a bouncing marshmallow navigating a series of platforms. The goal is to survive as long as possible, earning points by staying on the platforms and avoiding obstacles like enemies, spikes, and cliffs. With each bounce, the challenge increases, testing your reflexes and timing as you aim for the highest score.
